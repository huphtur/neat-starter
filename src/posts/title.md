## Right, but you brought up *Future Primitive*, that TG part was filmed just a few blocks away. Not to mention having Thrasher Magazine as a staple in your city. That’s a much different experience than most, myself included. 

I know what you’re saying, but we were still so young. We were just hyped on everything. Like those Golden Gate Park launch ramp sessions? Those were what you waited all week for. Sure, you skated with friends during the week, but you always knew that shit was about to go down on Sunday. People would come in from wherever, all over the city. And it was during that time when you knew who everybody was and where they were from. It wasn’t as popular as it is now, which is actually how I ended up meeting a lot of my friends back then. Because everybody would be there. Guys like Arco, Ken Takeda and Camden Scott, who was a fucking ripper. Ray Meyer and his crew. East Bay dudes, like Bryan Ferdinand and Wade Speyer. And occasionally, Tommy would show up and let everybody know how it was done. The right way. But yeah, all of these people influenced how I skated. 

I remember Mike Carroll skating there. He was only, like, 11 years old, but he could already ollie off a jump ramp super high. Almost as high as Tommy, actually. He was seriously like a child prodigy, for sure. He’s always been the prototype. Prodigy, prototype… everything just came naturally for him. 

**What’s the title again?** 

It’s called *[City Hunter](https://youtu.be/bQKFJMOP_e0?si=NwvbRyzrhCRwwNTQ)*.
